- real-time collab and sync with liveblocks and conflict resolution

- add styles (defined as prompt and optional reference images): random, empty or specific

- add smart prompt pre-processing (and that one decides what to give to nano banana)

- inside styles there should be some logic for generating ideas and copy and then image prompts
- add prompt upsampling with LLM (using style reference)
- add smarts to image editing (e.g. add logo)
- add magic button top left: just generates an advert based on the style and brief
